<p>subject: SciPy 2024 Tutorials and Teen Track: volunteers, assemble!</p>
<p>Dear {{Name}},</p>
<p>
  I am writing to you as you manifested interest in a previous survey for
  volunteering in assistance of the tutorial sessions or the Teen Track at SciPy
  2024. The work of volunteers consists in reporting to tutorial co-chairs and,
  within reason and ability, addressing the various issues that can hold up a
  tutorial in session -- wi-fi and general IT, audio-video equipment, physical
  access to the tutorial rooms, and so on.
</p>
<p>
  Could you please confirm your availability for volunteering during the
  tutorial sessions or the Teen Track? If you do, please take a look at the

  </a>
  and let us know which tutorials (or half-days of Teen Track) you could thus
  assist.
</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you in Tacoma! Best,</p>
<p>
  Benoit Hamelin<br />
  with the SciPy 2024 Tutorial Co-Chairs
